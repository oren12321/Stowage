# 📦 Stowage
**The Explicit PowerShell Workspace Orchestrator**

**Stowage** is a recursive build and packaging tool for PowerShell projects. Unlike standard module managers, Stowage follows a **"Pure & Encapsulated"** philosophy: it mirrors your internal project structure and inlines external dependencies into localized `Shared` folders.

## 🚀 Key Features
*   **Composite Orchestration**: Use the `SubProjects` field to map complex internal folder trees.
*   **Localized Inlining**: Every project gets its own private `Shared` folder for external dependencies.
*   **Collision Guard**: Atomic pre-build validation prevents naming conflicts and missing files.
*   **Identity Aliasing**: Rename dependencies on the fly to resolve conflicts or simplify paths.
*   **Path Mapping**: Automatically generates `Paths.ps1` for easy, relative dependency loading.
*   **PS 5.1 Native**: Works out-of-the-box on a fresh Windows installation.

## 🛠 How to Configure `Manifest.psd1`
Every folder in your tree must contain a `Manifest.psd1`. Stowage uses two primary fields to understand your project:

### 1. `SubProjects` (Internal)
Used for folders that are part of your own repository. These are mirrored to the build folder as-is.
```powershell
SubProjects = @(
    "src/Core",
    "src/Ui"
)
```

### 2. `Dependencies` (External)
Used for "foreign" code or assets. These are copied into a `Shared` folder at the project's level.
```powershell
Dependencies = @(
    "../External/Logger",               # Standard Project
    "../Assets/config.json",            # Static File Asset
    @{ Name="Net"; Path="../Network" }  # Aliased Dependency
    @{ GitHub = "Owner/Anvil"; Ref = "v2.0.1"; Name = "AnvilCore" }, # GitHub repo
)
```

## 🏗 Using the Build in Your Code
Stowage eliminates hardcoded paths. If a manifest has `Dependencies`, a `Paths.ps1` file is generated in that directory during the build.

**In your script:**
```powershell
# 1. Load the map
. "$PSScriptRoot\Paths.ps1"

# 2. Access your dependencies via the $Paths hashtable
. (Join-Path $Paths.Logger "Initialize.ps1")
$Config = Get-Content $Paths.'config.json'
```

---

## ⚙️ Execution
Run **Stowage.ps1** from the terminal:

### Standard Build
```powershell
.\Stowage.ps1 -ProjectPath "C:\Repo\MyApp" -Destination "C:\Builds"
```

### Inventory Check (Dry Run)
To see a full "Bill of Materials" and validate all paths without building:
```powershell
.\Stowage.ps1 -ProjectPath "C:\Repo\MyApp" -ListAvailable
```

## 🛡 Stability Guards
*   **Circularity Protection**: Detects and blocks infinite dependency loops.
*   **Security Scope**: Ensures `SubProjects` never point to folders outside the root project tree.
*   **Reserved Names**: Prevents dependencies from being named `Shared` or `Paths`.
*   **Atomic Validation**: If any dependency in the entire recursive tree is missing, the build stops before any files are modified.

## 📝 Best Practices
1.  **Explicit is Better**: Stowage will only pack what you explicitly list in your manifests.
2.  **Use Aliases**: If two sub-projects need different versions of a library named `Common`, alias them to `CommonV1` and `CommonV2`.
3.  **Static Assets**: If a folder doesn't have a manifest, Stowage treats it as a "Dead End" asset and copies it without recursing further.
